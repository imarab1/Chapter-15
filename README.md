Implement your own ArrayStack<E> that must include the following methods. You may assist your fellow students but do **NOT** share answers/code.

This repo contains a JUnit test case showcasing asserEquals's behavior. You need to add your own test cases to thoroughly test you code.
If you are using an IDE other than Geany, you must ensure that your code still passes all when run via GitHub Actions.

Be sure to document your source code with Javadoc and update this README. Please contact me if you need assistance.
